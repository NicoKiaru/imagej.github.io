Curtis Rueden is a research software engineer at [LOCI](/orgs/loci).
He is the principal architect of [ImageJ2](/software/imagej2),
and the current maintainer of the [Fiji](/software/fiji) distribution of ImageJ.

## Community support pledge

The ImageJ community generates a lot of support activity!
[Forum posts](https://forum.image.sc/tag/imagej), [bug reports](/discuss/bugs),
[chat room](/discuss/chat) messages, and
[mailing list threads](/discuss/mailing-lists), and [more](/discuss).
I want to help, but it's rather overwhelming, especially taken together
with new development efforts and collaborations that are always ongoing.

If you are reading this, perhaps you have posted issues or support requests
that have gone unanswered for weeks, months, or even years. I want to change
that, and am working on process improvements to make it easier for the core
ImageJ2 team to respond to every support request within one work day:

* **Better component status overview.** The site
  [status.scijava.org](https://status.scijava.org/) is a developer-oriented
  view of the status of every component in the SciJava
  [Bill of Materials](/develop/architecture#bill-of-materials), especially
  components built on [pom-scijava](https://github.com/scijava/pom-scijava).
  I am expanding the scope of the component table to include a summary of
  support requests, issues, pull requests, etc., per component, in a way that
  will foster accountability for the people maintaining each component.

* **Community Mondays.** In the meantime, I am personally focusing every Monday
  on answering support questions. I can't keep up with everything, but I can
  try to make some small impact by responding to as many requests as I can.
  Unfortunately, until the status.scijava.org work is complete, I won't always
  succeed in prioritizing items in a fair order, but I'm doing my best.

## What is Curtis working on?

### Weekly allocation of effort

| Day | Focus |
|----:|:------|
| **Mon** | Community support ([forum topics](https://forum.image.sc/u/ctrueden/activity/bookmarks), [issues](https://github.com/users/ctrueden/projects/1/views/3)) |
| **Tue** | Fiji maintenance ([PR queue](https://github.com/users/ctrueden/projects/1/views/2)) |
| **Wed** thru **Fri** | New development: SciJava Ops |

### Immediate priorities

- Make the mega-melt ({% include github org='scijava' repo='pom-scijava' issue=146 %}) fully work.
- (with {% include person id='hinerm' %} and {% include person id='gselzer' %}) **SciJava Ops** + **ImageJ Ops2** ([roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/scijava/projects/1)), including [JPMS/Jigsaw](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw/) modularization and migration of SciJava foundational libraries to Java 11.
- Finish revamping status.scijava.org ({% include github org='scijava' repo='status.scijava.org' branch='github-issues' label='scijava/status.scijava.org' %}).

### Short-term priorities

- **Integrate PyImageJ with the ImageJ launcher.** (see also [this forum discussion](https://forum.image.sc/t/fiji-conda/59618/13))
- **Upgrade component stack to Java 11/17.** (with {% include person id='axtimwalde' %}) Migrate ImageJ2 and Fiji to ship with Java 11 or 17 ([roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/imagej/projects/4)), with a **Maven-based ImageJ update site generator** to simplify creation and maintenance of update sites.
- **Better javadoc.scijava.org.** ({% include github org='scijava' repo='pom-scijava' issue=130 %})

### Medium-term priorities

- **Finish the imagej.net statbox feature.** ([related issues](https://github.com/imagej/imagej.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+statbox)).
- **GitHub issue reporting plugin.** The Fiji BugZilla and ImageJ Trac are now static content only. The [Report a Bug](/discuss/bugs) plugin needs to send reports to GitHub instead. ([scijava/scijava-plugins-issues-github](https://github.com/scijava/scijava-plugins-issues-github))
- **Fix the ImageJ Server.** ({% include github org='imagej' repo='imagej-server' issue=41 %}, {% include github org='scijava' repo='pom-scijava' issue=133 %}).

### Longer-term priorities

- **Rich Image.** Improve the [ImageJ Common](/libs/imagej-common) data model to support metadata (e.g., spatial transformations) as a first-class citizen. ([imagej/imagej-common@rich](https://github.com/imagej/imagej-common/compare/rich), [imagej/janelia-hackathon-2016](https://github.com/imagej/janelia-hackathon-2016))
- **SCIFIO blockization.** ({% include github org='scifio' repo='scifio' issue=283 %})
- **ImageJ Launcher.** Switch to a JavaFX-based native launcher. Retire the current ImageJ Launcher.
  ({% include github org='imagej' repo='imagej-launcher' issue=33 %})
- **ImageJ Electron app.** Shared memory between Java, JavaScript and Python. ([imagej/imagej-electron-app](https://github.com/imagej/imagej-electron-app))
